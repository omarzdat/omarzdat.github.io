# Stillbirth Site Wireframes

Below is the repository for all wirefranes for this project.
The purpose of wireframing in HTML is to get a feel for the responsiveness, layout, and interactions while still keeping a reduced design and a low-code implementation. For a project such as this, the content and images may change, but the crux of the project is in its interactions, which this wireframe implementation showcases as best as possible.

Where necessary, comments explain functionality that would otherwise be difficult to implement in this redux wireframe set.
